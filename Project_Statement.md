#### \# Project Statement: Heart Rate Analysis Tool



#### \## Problem Statement



Many individuals can measure their heart rate using watches, fitness bands or manual methods, but they often cannot interpret whether the readings fall within a normal range. Manual interpretation can be confusing and inconsistent. A simple software tool is needed that accepts heart-rate readings, analyzes them and presents easy-to-understand results along with a graphical representation.

#### 

#### \## Scope of the Project

#### 

This project focuses on building a basic yet functional Heart-Rate Analysis Tool using Python.

The scope includes:



\* Taking heart-rate readings along with time

\* Validating input values

\* Calculating minimum, maximum and average

\* Checking whether the average is in a safe range

\* Generating a text report

\* Displaying a line graph using matplotlib

\* Keeping modules clean and separated



The project does not cover database storage, advanced medical interpretation or mobile/GUI development at this stage.



#### \## Target Users



\* Fitness beginners tracking basic heart rates

\* Students learning Python modules and data visualization

\* Individuals who want a quick interpretation tool for heart-rate values

\* Anyone interested in basic health data analysis



#### \## High-Level Features



\* Validated heart-rate input collection

\* Calculation of summary statistics

\* Safety range checking (normal, low, high)

\* Text-based analysis report

\* Graph plotting for heart rate vs time

\* Modular Python design for readability and easy modification
