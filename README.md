# Heart_Rate_Monitoring_Tool
The​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ project is a straightforward modular Python setup that gathers heart-rate data, calculates stats values, verifies if the rate is within the safe range (60-100 bpm), and returns the output via summary and a graph. The code is divided into 5 independent modules with clean architecture and accurate ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌documentation.
